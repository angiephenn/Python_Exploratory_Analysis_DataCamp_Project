# Python_Exploratory_Analysis_DataCamp_Project

The objective of this GitHub project is to analyze employee churn within organizations and develop predictive models using data science techniques. By understanding the factors influencing employee turnover and creating accurate prediction models, the project aims to help organizations improve employee retention strategies and satisfaction. Exploratory analysis techniques will be employed to uncover patterns and trends in the data, providing valuable insights for modeling and prediction. The project aims to facilitate data-driven decision-making to mitigate the negative impact of employee churn.

 # Key Features

- Exploratory Analysis: Conducting an in-depth exploration of the data related to employee churn, such as employee demographics, tenure, pay, job satisfaction, salary, working conditions, growth potential, and other relevant factors. This analysis helps in understanding the current state of employee churn within the organization.

- Cluster Analysis: Utilizing clustering techniques to identify patterns and groups within the employee data. This analysis can help in identifying distinct employee segments or profiles based on various attributes and their likelihood of churn.

- Building a Prediction Model: Developing a predictive model using machine learning algorithms to forecast employee churn. This involves selecting appropriate features, preprocessing the data, and training a model that can accurately predict the likelihood of an employee leaving the company.

- Evaluating Model Performance: Assessing the performance of the prediction model by measuring metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. It is essential to evaluate the model's effectiveness in correctly identifying employees who are likely to churn and minimizing false positives and false negatives.
